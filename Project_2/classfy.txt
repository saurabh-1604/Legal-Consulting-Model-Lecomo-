To modify the code to allow multiple IPC sections as output for one case, you need to make changes in the data preprocessing step and in the output layer of the neural network model.

Here's how you can modify the code:

Data Preprocessing:

Instead of mapping each case to a single IPC section, map each case to multiple IPC sections.
You can represent the output labels as a multi-label classification problem, where each case can have multiple IPC sections associated with it.
Model Output Layer:

Modify the output layer of the neural network model to output probabilities for each IPC section.
Since it's a multi-label classification problem, you can use the sigmoid activation function in the output layer.
Adjust the loss function accordingly to handle multi-label classification.
Here's the modified code:

python
Copy code
import json
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Load JSON data
with open('modified_sections.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract texts and labels
texts = [entry['case'] for entry in data]
labels = [entry['IPC_Section'].split(', ') for entry in data]  # Split multiple IPC sections

# Tokenize texts
max_words = 1000
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_words, oov_token='<OOV>')
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

# Pad sequences
maxlen = 100
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen, padding='post', truncating='post')

# Convert labels to binary representation for multi-label classification
label_dict = {label: i for i, label in enumerate(set([item for sublist in labels for item in sublist]))}
labels_encoded = np.zeros((len(labels), len(label_dict)), dtype=np.int)
for i, label_list in enumerate(labels):
    for label in label_list:
        labels_encoded[i, label_dict[label]] = 1

# Define model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(max_words, 32),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(len(label_dict), activation='sigmoid')  # Use sigmoid for multi-label classification
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])  # Use binary cross-entropy for multi-label classification

# Train model
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels_encoded, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
This modified code will allow the model to predict multiple IPC sections as output for each case. Ensure that your data is properly formatted to handle multiple IPC
